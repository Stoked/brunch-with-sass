# Brunch with SASS - The sassy way
![](https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/b7ebb8bbcec7938940cf8e9c441124c3bddafd3a/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f34373039326b30423141334a317a3166306b34362f6277632e706e67)

This brunch skeleton is a alternative to the [sassy-brunch](https://github.com/bc-luke/sassy-brunch) suggested by [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/wiki/Skeletons#wiki-backbone). The reason for creating this repository is that the sassy-brunch skeleton is outdated and doesn't work anymore. Feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own brunch applications.

This skeleton is a fork of the Brunch with Chaplin skeleton and only difference between these skeletons is the use of sass instead of stylus.
