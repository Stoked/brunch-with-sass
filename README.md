# Brunch with SASS - The sassy way
![](https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/b7ebb8bbcec7938940cf8e9c441124c3bddafd3a/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f34373039326b30423141334a317a3166306b34362f6277632e706e67)

This git repository is a alternative to the [sassy-brunch](https://github.com/bc-luke/sassy-brunch) suggested by [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/wiki/Skeletons#wiki-backbone). The reason for creating this repository is that the sassy-brunch skeleton is outdated and doesn't work anymore. 

Feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own brunch applications.

This is HTML5 application, built with
[Brunch](http://brunch.io) and
[Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org).

## Installation
Clone this repo manually with Git or use `brunch new gh:stefanvermaas/brunch-with-sass`.

## Getting started
* Install [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`.
* Install Brunch plugins and Bower components: `npm install & bower install`.
* Watch the project with continuous rebuild by
`brunch watch --server`. This will also launch HTTP server.
* `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.
* Write your code in `app` dir.
* Optionally, you can scaffold things, see readme in `generators` directory.
* For production, build minified project with `brunch build --optimize`.
